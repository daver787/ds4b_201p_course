# BUSINESS SCIENCE UNIVERSITY
# COURSE: DS4B 201-P PYTHON MACHINE LEARNING
# MODULE 0: MACHINE LEARNING & API'S JUMPSTART 
# PART 1: PYCARET
# ----

# GOAL: Make an introductory ML lead scoring model
#  that can be used in an API

# LIBRARIES

import os
import pandas as pd
import sqlalchemy as sql
import pycaret.classification as clf


# 1.0 READ DATA ----

# Connect to SQL Database ----

engine = sql.create_engine("sqlite:///00_database/crm_database.sqlite")

conn = engine.connect()

sql.inspect(engine).get_table_names()

# * Subscribers ---


# * Transactions


# *Close Connection ----



# 2.0 SIMPLIFIED DATA PREP ----



# 3.0 QUICKSTART MACHINE LEARNING WITH PYCARET ----

# * Subset the data ----


# * Setup the Classifier ----


# * Make A Machine Learning Model ----


# * Finalize the model ----


# * Predict -----


# * Save the Model ----



# * Load the model -----



# CONCLUSIONS:
# * Insane that we did all of this in 90 lines of code
# * And the model was better than random guessing...
# * But, there are questions that come to mind...

# KEY QUESTIONS:
# * SHOULD WE EVEN TAKE ON THIS PROJECT? (COST/BENEFIT)
# * MACHINE LEARNING MODEL - IS IT GOOD?
# * WHAT CAN WE DO TO IMPROVE THE MODEL?
# * WHAT ARE THE KEY FEATURES IN THE MODEL?
# * CAN WE EXPLAIN WHY CUSTOMERS ARE BUYING / NOT BUYING?
# * CAN THE COMPANY MAKE A RETURN ON INVESTMENT FROM THIS MODEL?
